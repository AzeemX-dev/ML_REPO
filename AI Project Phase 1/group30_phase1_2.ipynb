These examples consist of hand-written digits that belong to ten different classes (numbers 1 through 10). The given images have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It would also be highly advisable to go through [this link](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) the information provided in this link to fully understand this dataset.\n",
